We have to complete the following in the coming week

    Go through the tutorials. 
    Decide which web framework you want to use (Django/Flask/something else)
    Mindmap potential solutions for your problem. Decide on features and which features you want to implement (prioritize)
    Create page mockups with workflow (e.g. how the first page will look like, what happens when user clicks on a button, how the next page looks like what is the 'user's journey in your website etc).  
    Check this article on 'paper prototyping' a website https://medium.com/digital-experience-design/a-guide-to-paper-prototyping-testing-for-web-interfaces-49e542ba765f See if you can do something similar (Its ok if you decide not to do it this way)

All your documents/mindmaps/prototypes/experiments must be in Git so that I can check and help you in case of any problems.
